## ELF parser

### Project description

In order to practice my Golang coding skill and to deepen my knowledge in the ELF file format, I crafted this small piece of code - a small implementation of an ELF parser.

The logic is based on multiple sources of documentation and mainly on the great book “Learning Linux binary analysis”.

### How to use the tool

```
